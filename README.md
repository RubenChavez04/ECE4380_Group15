#ECE4310_Group15
##This repo contains the work completed for group 15's capstone project for ECE 4310 (Embedded Systems)
#
##To run the following code, you need one esp32 and one stm32,
#
#Prerequsites 
## - Have the capability to flash code onto an stm and esp via arduino IDE
## - Have all libraries used installed
##    - LittleFS
##    - AdaFruitINA
##    - time
## - Have the correct components (2x INA219 current sensors, 2 relay modules, and 2 DC device you would like to control)
#
##Once you flash your devices, you'll be able to connect to esp via wifi and access a local webpage at http://192.168.4.1. From here you can see the live power readings, set power thresholds, and control the relays.
